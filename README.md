# BookingHotelNLP

**Intro** <br>
This section contains a brief description of the project. The theme revolves around the concept of Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis (SA), an Artificial Intelligence field whose main purpose is the training of computers to determine if the emotional tone of a sentence is positive, negative or neutral. In this project the main concern is to determine whether a customer's opinion is classified in one of the three "sentiment" classes mentioned, based on the reviews scraped from the Booking website using Web Scraping libraries.

**Employed technologies** <br>
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup
Data structure for storage: Pandas DataFrame
NLP for SA models: BERTweet
Text processing API: TextBlob
