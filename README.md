# BookingHotelNLP

**Intro** <br>
This section contains a brief description of the project. The theme revolves around the concept of Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis (SA), an Artificial Intelligence field whose primary purpose is computer training to determine if a sentence's emotional tone is positive, negative, or neutral. In this project the main concern is determining whether a customer's opinion is classified in one of the three "sentiment" classes mentioned, based on the reviews scraped from the Booking website using Web Scraping libraries.

**Employed technologies** <br>
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup <br>
Data structure for storage: Pandas DataFrame <br>
NLP for SA models: BERTweet <br>
Text processing API: TextBlob <br>
